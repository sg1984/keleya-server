Keleya server

This is a NodeJS backend system.

### Required systems in your machine
* Yarn
* NodeJS
* MySQL database

Also, there is a file called `.env.example` with the configuration data for your system, please update it with the information needed, OK?

To run the system:
- 
* `mv .env.example .env`
* `yarn`
* `npm start` 
* If you are religious, pray. If not, send some positive energy.
* After it is running, to play around a little bit, you can reach to `<INSERT_LOCAL_SERVER_ADDRESS_HERE>/api-docs` to play with the Swagger endpoints.

If you see any problem, please reach out so I can fix it ASAP.

Thanks!
